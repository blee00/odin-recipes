        <h2>Description</h2>
          <p>The name ratatouille has its roots in the French <em>ratouiller</em>, an expressive form of a verb, meaning 'to stir'. 
          This illustrates the nature of the dish in its usual form - a stew - one which is noticeably different than the popularized
          <em>confit byaldi</em> variation, created by French chef Michael Guérard.
          </p>
          <p>The dish's ingredients and recipes have varied wildly since its conception but its modern versions consist of
            tomatoes, zucchinis, eggplants, bell peppers, and a few spices. This is recipe is portioned for 4 servings.
