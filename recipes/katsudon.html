        <h2>Description</h2>
          <p>Katsudon is a Japanese food consisting of breaded, deep-fried pork cutlet over rice, topped with a partially beaten egg and 
            varying condiments. This dish takes its name from two Japanese words: <em>tonkatsu</em> and <em>donburi</em>, which mean 
            pork cutlet and rice bowl dish, respectively.
          </p>
          <p>Interestingly, katsudon has a modern tradition of being eaten by Japanese students prior to important tests or school entrance exams.
            This tradition was spurred by the <em>katsu</em> part of katsudon, as it's homophonous with another Japanese word meaning "to win" or
            "to be victorious". As for this is recipe it is portioned for 4 servings.

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>2 center-cut boneless pork chops, pounded down to 1 centimeter thick</li>
            <li>Salt and ground black pepper</li>
            <li>All-purpose flour</li>
            <li>5 large eggs, beaten, divided</li>
            <li>1 cup panko</li>
            <li>Oil, for frying</li>
            <li>1 ¼ cups dashi soup stock</li>
            <li>⅓ cup soy sauce</li>
            <li>2 Tbsp. mirin</li>
            <li>1 Tbsp. sugar</li>
            <li>1 medium onion, thinly sliced</li>
            <li>4 cups steamed white rice</li>
          </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
          <ol>
            <li>Season the pounded pork chops with salt and pepper. Then, lightly dust an even coating of flour.</li>
            <li>Have a beaten egg in one bowl and have panko in another bowl.</li>
            <li>Add an even layer of oil to a cast-iron pan or skillet over medium heat. The oil is ready when you drop a panko breadcrumb into it and it sizzles.</li>
            <li>Dip the flour-coated pork into the beaten egg, coat both sides; then, transfer the pork to the panko and press it evenly into the meat.</li>
            <li>Lay the pork chops in the hot oil and cook for 5 to 6 minutes on each side for a total of 10 to 12 minutes or until golden brown and cooked through.</li>
            <li>Drain on a plate lined with a paper towel and then slice your tonkatsu into pieces.</li>
            <li>Put the dashi soup stock in a pan and heat on medium heat. Then, add the soy sauce, mirin, and sugar; bring to a boil and remove from heat.</li>
            <li>For 1 serving of katsudon, put 1/4 of the soup and 1/4 of the sliced onion in a small skillet, then simmer for a few minutes on medium heat.</li>
            <li>Add 1 serving of tonkatsu (half of 1 pork cutlet) to the skillet and simmer on low heat for a few minutes.</li>
            <li>Beat one of the other eggs in a bowl and bring the soup to a boil; then, pour the egg over the tonkatsu and onion.</li>
            <li>Turn the heat to low, cover with a lid, and cook until the egg has set; then, remove it from the heat.</li>
            <li>Place 1 serving of steamed rice (1 cup) in a rice bowl, top it with the simmered tonkatsu and serve. Repeat to make 3 more servings.</li>
          </ol>
