        <h2>Description</h2>
          <p>Katsudon is a Japanese food consisting of breaded, deep-fried pork cutlet over rice, topped with a partially beaten egg and 
            varying condiments. This dish takes its name from two Japanese words: <em>tonkatsu</em> and <em>donburi</em>, which mean 
            pork cutlet and rice bowl dish, respectively.
          </p>
          <p>Interestingly, katsudon has a modern tradition of being eaten by Japanese students prior to important tests or school entrance exams.
            This tradition was spurred by the <em>katsu</em> part of katsudon, as it's homophonous with another Japanese word meaning "to win" or
            "to be victorious". This is a recipe for 4 servings.

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>2 center-cut boneless pork chops, pounded down to 1 centimeter thick</li>
            <li>Salt and ground black pepper</li>
            <li>All-purpose flour</li>
            <li>5 large eggs, beaten, divided</li>
            <li>1 cup panko</li>
            <li>Oil, for frying</li>
            <li>1 1/4 cups dashi soup stock</li>
            <li>1/3 cup soy sauce</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons mirin</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon sugar</li>
            <li>1 medium onion, thinly sliced</li>
            <li>4 cups steamed white rice</li>
          </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
          <ol>
            <li>Season the pounded pork chops with salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Dust with a light, even coating of flour.</li>
            <li>In one shallow bowl, beat 1 of the eggs. Put the panko into another shallow bowl.</li>
            <li>Add a thin, even layer of oil to a cast-iron pan or skillet over medium heat. The oil is ready when you drop a panko breadcrumb into it and it sizzles.</li>
            <li>Dip the flour-dusted pork into the egg to coat both sides.</li>
            <li>Transfer the pork to the panko and press it evenly into the meat to get a good coating.</li>
            <li>Carefully lay the pork chops in the hot oil and cook for 5 to 6 minutes on one side, until golden brown.</li>
            <li>Flip and cook the other side for another 5 to 6 minutes, or until browned, crispy, and cooked through.</li>
            <li>Drain on a plate lined with a paper towel.</li>
            <li>Slice your tonkatsu into pieces.</li>
            <li>Put the dashi soup stock in a pan and heat on medium heat.</li>
            <li>To cook 1 serving of katsudon, put 1/4 of the soup and 1/4 of the sliced onion in a small skillet. Simmer for a few minutes on medium heat.</li>
            <li>Add 1 serving of tonkatsu pieces (half of 1 pork cutlet) to the pan and simmer on low heat for a few minutes.</li>
            <li>Beat another one of the eggs in a bowl. Bring the soup to a boil and pour the egg over the tonkatsu and onion.</li>
            <li>Turn the heat down to low and cover with a lid. Cook until the egg has set and remove it from the heat. The egg should be cooked through.</li>
            <li>Serve by placing 1 serving of steamed rice in a large rice bowl. Top with the simmered tonkatsu on top of the rice. Repeat to make 3 more servings.</li>
          </ol>
